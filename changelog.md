# Changelog

## 0.6.2

- Add `end` parameter as a new stage to crawl path. It calls an async function
  that can be used to clean up after crawling or trigger some processes needed
  to refresh data in the application.

## 0.6.1

- Update extraction-worker and eth-fun to new minor versions which allow
  getting a transaction by hash.

## 0.6.0

- `config.environment` (including overwritten environment variables) is now
  passed into `extractor.{init|update}`. We stop recommend using `process.env`
  in strategies.
- For `coordinator.remote` the input is now an object `remote({environment, execute})`. Here, we also stop recommend using `process.env` directly.
- Previously, although stated in the docs, defining a value in
  `config.environment` did NOT take presedence over its `process.env`
  counter-part. It does now.
- Priorly, only the first path element in the configuration file could define a
  "coordinator". We now allow all path elements to define coordinators. They're
  executed in parallel. However, coordinators are still not documented...

## 0.5.3

- Add flag `path[0].coordinator.archive: Boolean` that allows to delete
  extraction and transformation files after a single coordinator run.
- Fix a crash that occurred in coordinator when transformation or extraction
  files were not present (e.g. when there weren't any crawl results).

## 0.5.2

- @attestate/kiwistand was crashing on a small Digital Ocean instance because
  all MDB readers were used
  [[issue](https://github.com/attestate/kiwistand/issues/34)]. We demonstrated
  that it can be fixed by increasing lmdb's `maxReaders` to 500. Hence, we have
  added a parameter to `database.open(path, maxReaders)`.

## 0.5.1

- `function lifecycle.load()` now exits gracefully when prior transform job has
  no processable outputs.

## 0.5.0

- (breaking) `config.path[]` for transformer, extractor and loader, the
  properties `output.path` and `input.path` were renamed to `output.name` and
  doesn't have to be a path anymore. Instead, they are file names that are
  automatically resolved from within `env.DATA_DIR`.
- (breaking) `process.env` variables defined in the `.env` file can now also be
  defined (and overwritten) in the `config.mjs` file's `environment` property.
- (breaking) All lifecycle methods now have an updated interface as outlined
  below:
  - extractor `function init({ state, args, execute })`
  - extractor `function update({ message })`
  - tranformer `function onLine({ state })` where `state.line` is the line
    function. `args` can be matched too.
  - loader `function* order({ state })` where `state.line` is the line
  - loader `function* direct({ state })` where `state.line` is the line
- There is a new component to a strategy called the "coordinator" that keeps
  track of state. The config.mjs file (the `path` property) features a new
  field called `coordinator` where a `module` and an `interval` can be defined.
  They're used to re-run the first path once all jobs have been completed, to
  e.g. keep in synchronization with a network like Ethereum.
- We forked the extraction-worker from the neume-network organization and added
  a feature to immediately execute a worker message. More details:
  https://github.com/attestate/extraction-worker/.
- Reference docs for the extraction worker have been added.
- Reference docs for the crawler CLI have been added.
- Note: The `@attestate/crawler-call-block-logs` module at version 0.3.0 is
  compatible.

## 0.4.0

- (breaking) Create two separate LMDB tables for "order" and "load" data
- Add `crawler.mjs range` command
- Add Strategy Specification sphinx page

## 0.3.0

- (breaking) Change `loader.handler` to two generator functions `order` and
  `direct` as a property called `module` (consistent with extractor and
  transformer)
- (breaking) `configuration.output.path` object is now required
- (breaking) `configuration.loader.module` object is now required
- Integrate with LMDB to persist loader data

## 0.2.0

- (breaking) Merge crawl path and configuration file into configuration file
- (breaking) Move `EXTRACTION_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` into configuration file

## 0.1.0

[skipped by accident]

## 0.0.1

- Initial release
